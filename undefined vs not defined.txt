undefined vs not defined

undefined is a special keyword in JavaScript. It is not there is other languages.
As we know, JavaScrit allocates memory to the variables even before the code is executed. And during memory allocation, JS puts a placeholder against the variables and that is undefined. undefined acts as a placeholder which is kept for the time being until the variaible is assgined a value in the code.

And so, it is different than 'not defined'. An error that we get when we try to access a variable which is not declared/defined in the code. We can also say that a variable which has not been allocated memory, is 'not defined'.

Also, we should not assgin variables 'undefined' manually. Using undefined for this purpose can be confusing because 'undefined' has a specific meaning in the language related to uninitialized variables.
Use of null Instead: In JavaScript and some other languages, it's more appropriate to use the null value to represent the absence of a value or an empty state.
