The functions have their own execution context.
So, the memory space and code execution part is also inside their execution context.
The global execution context and the execution context of the function(s) will have their own memory space and virtual kind of running environment.

Hence, sometimes if the variables having same name are used over the code, inside and outside the functions, their values differs. Below is the code snippet demonstrating the same:


var x = 1;
a();
b();

function a() {
    var x = 10;
    console.log(x);
}

function b() {
    var x = 100;
    console.log(x);
}
